# momer: Exposing the Python library momepy in R

# ðŸš§ðŸš§ðŸš§ UNDER CONSTRUCTION ðŸš§ðŸš§ðŸš§

`momer` is an R wrapper for the
[`momepy`](https://docs.momepy.org/en/stable/index.html)
Python library for morphometric analysis. Its main purpose is to make the
tools of `momepy` available to R users, while keeping the interface as close
to the original as possible. `momer` is synchronised with `momepy` and is
updated with every new release.
