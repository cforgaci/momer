# Signatories
<!--
This section provides the ISC with a view of the support received from
the community for a proposal. Acceptance isn't predicated on
popularity but community acceptance is important. Willingness to
accept outside input is also a good marker for project delivery.

An optional section would be for R-Core signatories where changes to R
are proposed.

Developer of `moempy` Martin Fleischmann, as well as members of the [Rbanism community](https://rbanism.org/), represented by community leads [Cl√©mentine Cottineau](https://clementinecttn.github.io/), [Daniele Cannatella](https://3d.bk.tudelft.nl/dcannatella/) and Claudiu Forgaci; the [r-spatial community](https://r-spatial.org/), represented by [Tim Appelhans](https://github.com/tim-salabim) confirm the relevance of this project and its expected impact on the field of urban morphometrics and the R spatial ecosystem.

## Project team
<!--
Who are the people responsible for actually delivering the project if
the proposal gets accepted and are already signed up and rearing to
go? Briefly describe all participants and the skills they will bring
to the project.
-->

[Claudiu Forgaci]() is assistant professor of urban design and analytics engaged in urban morphology research and experienced in R package development (see [rcrisp](https://github.com/CityRiverSpaces/rcrisp), [rcoins](https://github.com/CityRiverSpaces/rcoins), and [visor](https://github.com/CityRiverSpaces/visor)). He is also a member of the Spatial Data Science across Languages (SDSL) community with a special interest in cross-language projects. He is also one of the initiators of the [Rbanism community](https://rbanism.org/) promoting reproducibility, automation and scalability in urbanism research using R. Claudiu will lead the development of `momer` and will maintain it after completion.

[Elviss Dvinskis](https://www.tudelft.nl/en/digital-competence-centre/team/elviss-dvinskis) is a research data engineer at the TU Delft Digital Competence Center (DCC) experienced in Python and R package development. With an extensive [project history](https://www.tudelft.nl/digital-competence-centre/projects) and [expertise](https://www.tudelft.nl/digital-competence-centre/our-expertise), the DCC provides in-kind support for researchers at TU Delft. Elviss will carry out the software engineering work planned in this project with a commitment of 0.4FTE for the planned duration of the project.
