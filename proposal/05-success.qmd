# Success
<!--
Projects should have a definition of done that is measurable, and a
thorough understanding going in of what the risks are to delivery
-->

## Definition of done
<!--
What does success look like?
-->

A successful project will deliver a functional and well-documented `momer`
package. The package will provide R users with access to the functionalities
of the Python library `momepy`, enabling them to perform urban morphometric
analyses within R.

## Measuring success
<!--
How will we know when success is achieved, what markers can we use
along the way
-->

Success can be measured against the following indicators:

- Timely completion of all project milestones;
- Positive feedback from user testing and community engagement;
- Adoption of the `momer` package by the R community, as seen in the
  number of downloads, citations, and contributions;
- Successful integration and functionality of all wrapped `momepy` features;
- Successful synchronisation of the documentation between `momepy` and `momer`
  triggered at every new `momepy` release;
- Synchronised, comprehensive and clear documentation, including vignettes and
  examples, aligned with CRAN policies;
- Active post-release maintenance and updates, reflecting ongoing community
  needs and developments in the field of urban morphometrics.

## Future work
<!--
How could this be extended / developed in the future by yourself
and/or the community in general?
-->

The `momer` project is instrumental for the development of a cross-language infrastructure as it will grow a critical mass of users beyond Python and will help identify pressing high-level cross-language challenges that can serve other similar projects as well.
